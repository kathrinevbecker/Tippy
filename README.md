## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Simulator view would not correctly display app configured for iPhone 5s; had to adjust to 6s
- Instructions unclear about how to add a readme file. One set indicates that the readme should be created right after finishing creating the app in xcode, implying that the readme is made in xcode. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to do that, eventually decided to skip it and just upload the file to github... and then realized that the readme is created IN github.
